📌 Overview

The Rainfall Prediction System is a machine learning–based project that predicts whether rainfall will occur using historical weather data. This system helps in agriculture planning, water resource management, flood prevention, and weather forecasting by analyzing patterns in past data.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze historical weather and rainfall data

Identify important factors affecting rainfall

Build a machine learning model for prediction

Evaluate model accuracy and performance

Provide reliable rainfall predictions

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Tools: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Dataset: Public weather datasets (Kaggle / IMD)
